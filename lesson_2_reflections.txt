1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A hidden folder .git is created, it's a place where all metadata about commits is stored. We need to do it to create and store commits we've made.

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It containes only files that we would like to put in the commit. It give us flexibiblity to add to a commit logical changes, or separate to different logical commits changes in a whole working directory.
